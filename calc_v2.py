#You can use the same code from calc_v1.py, 
#but you need to figure where to add the statements and expressions from challenge 1


#Challenge 1: Ask user if he/she wants to do another calculation, if he/she says yes, then run the program again
#The user input should ask 'Would you like to run another program?(yes/no): '
#If the user inputs 'yes', then run the program again
#If the user inputs 'no', then print 'Bye!' and end the program
