# calculator
This is the first set of activities in this python course. You will need to apply your knowledge on statements, expressions, operators, and conditionals in order to complete the activities.

# exercises
There are 3 different exercises in order of difficulty. You must complete calc_v1.py before you can move on to the other exercises. Each exercise comes with #comments that contain the instructions in order to complete the exercises. Once you have followed the instructions and completed the exercise, you can test your code to see if it passes all the criteria.

You must add comments explaining how you developed your code and what methods and functions were used at the bottom of your code. If you do not add the explanation, then you will lose points.

# tests
Tests are used by real developers in order to check if their code works correctly. The tests automatically apply a range of parameters to each function expecting to see a certain output. The tests will indicate to you how many tests you passed and failed. If you failed any parts, the tests will indicate which function with which parameters failed. Use the fail statements to look into which parts of your code didn't work and try to figure out why.

You can only run a test program if you're using an IDE, like VScode. There are two ways to run a test program.
1: Click run button file in the top right corner
2: type this statement into your CLI in VScode: python -m unittest test_calc_v1.py or python3 -m unittest test_calc_v1.py

Make sure you run the same version of test as the exercise (ex: calc_v3.py == test_calc_v3.py)
