#Challenge 2: Add error statements where necessary. 
#Think about where you need to add error statements before you start changing the code.
#To show the error, your code should print an error message that says 'Invalid input'
#In this case, you might need to make small adjustments to your code in calc_v1 and/or calc_v2

#Completing this challenge will be easier if you understand what in and not in do in Python. Google it!
