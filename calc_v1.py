"""Your task is to create a calculator program that runs in the CLI.
Follow the instructions below and run the test file whenever you're ready 
to check if your program is correct."""

#Create a function to return two added numbers, function must be called add


#Create a function to return two subtracted numbers, function must be called subtract


#Create a function to return two multiplied numbers, function must be called multiply


#Create a function to return two divided numbers, function must be called divide


#Create a function to return the remainder of two numbers, function must be called remainder


#Create a function to return the exponent of two numbers, function must be called exponent



'''Create the main function here which will ask for user input about the type of program
he/she wants to use and then asks for their two numbers'''
#Create main function and print a list of all the types of programs your calculator offers


#Get user input on the type of program and the two numbers needed for the program


#Based on the user input, the requested program should run 
#ex: if user input 1, it means they want to add two numbers, but what happens if they input 2, which program should run


#Make sure you call the main function outside of itself so that it actually runs in the CLI.
#Place the main function inside the if __name__ == "__main__": block
#Not sure what calling a function means? Google it!
if __name__ == "__main__":


#The if statement above is used to make sure you can run tests to check 
#if your program is working correctly.
